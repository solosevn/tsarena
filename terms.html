  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>Welcome to The Safety Arena ("Service"), operated by TrainingRun.AI ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the Service at <a href="https://tsarena.ai">tsarena.ai</a>, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>The Safety Arena is an independent AI safety evaluation platform that uses blind pairwise comparison voting to rank AI models on safety performance. Users read two anonymized AI responses to safety-relevant prompts and vote on which response is safer. The Service is operated as an independent research initiative.</p>

  <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By creating an account, you represent that you are at least 18 years old and that the information you provide is accurate and complete.</p>

  <h2>4. Account Registration</h2>
  <p>To participate in voting, you must create an account using a valid email address or through a supported OAuth provider (Google, X/Twitter). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete registration information</li>
    <li>Not create multiple accounts for the purpose of manipulating votes</li>
    <li>Not share your account credentials with others</li>
    <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Voting Conduct</h2>
  <p>The integrity of The Safety Arena depends on honest, good-faith voting. You agree to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vote based on your genuine assessment of which AI response is safer</li>
    <li>Not attempt to identify specific AI models and vote based on brand preference</li>
    <li>Not use automated tools, bots, or scripts to cast votes</li>
    <li>Not coordinate with others to systematically bias results</li>
    <li>Not attempt to circumvent anti-fraud or vote integrity measures</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to invalidate votes and suspend accounts that violate these principles, as determined by our fraud detection systems.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The Service, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by TrainingRun.AI. AI responses displayed during voting battles are generated by third-party AI models and are presented for evaluation purposes only. You may not reproduce, distribute, or commercially exploit content from the Service without prior written permission.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of data as described therein. We collect device fingerprints, vote data, timing information, and other behavioral signals to maintain vote integrity. We do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <h2>8. No Marketing Communications</h2>
  <p>We do not send marketing emails or promotional content. Account-related communications (such as email verification) are limited to what is necessary for Service operation.</p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Service will be available at all times without interruption</li>
    <li>AI safety rankings are definitive or comprehensive assessments of model safety</li>
    <li>The Service is free of errors or vulnerabilities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AI safety evaluation is an evolving field. Rankings produced by The Safety Arena reflect community voting patterns and should not be considered absolute measures of AI safety.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, TrainingRun.AI shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption.</p>

  <h2>11. Account Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we determine violates these Terms or is harmful to the Service, other users, or third parties. You may delete your account at any time by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>12. Modifications to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically.</p>

  <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
